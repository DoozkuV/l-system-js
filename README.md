# Tree Renderer

This is a simple demonstration of generating a tree using Lindenmayer systems. You can view it directly at https://doozkuv.github.io/l-system-js/

## Features
- Randomly generates a tree structure with adjustable depth.
- Interactive canvas: click to generate a new tree.
- Slider to control the depth of the tree.

## How to run locally
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Adjust the depth using the slider.
3. Click the "New Tree" button or the canvas to generate a new tree.

## Code Structure
- `l-system.js`: Contains the logic for generating the tree structure.
- `canvas-renderer.js`: Handles rendering the tree on the canvas.
- `main.js`: Manages user interactions and initializes the tree.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file with the canvas and controls.

## Dependencies
- None, just a modern browser with JavaScript support.
